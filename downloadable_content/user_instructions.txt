How to upload a JSON as a user:

Once you are on the webpage, you can upload a JSON file which matches this kind of format (do not use it as it is, this is just an example, delete # lines first) :

CAUTION: the following parameters which are lists work serverside (they all the results) with several elements, however the web app only handles one result, so you should use one-element lists when it is recommanded in order to use the web app correctly.


{
 "dataset": {
	"filename" : "<path to your csv file>", #path to your csv file: ./dataset/iris.csv OR ./dataset.churn_dataset.csv are the default ones
   "separator" : "," #enter your separator here
 },
 "training": [0.7], #or any list of training ratios in ]0,1[, ONE ELEMENT ONLY IS RECOMMANDED
 "target_variable": "variety", #you target variable
 "metrics" : ['accuracy', 'confusion', 'macro_precision', 'macro_recall', 'macro_f1'], #you can select a sublist of this one
 "max_depth" : [5], #or any list of integers above 1, ONE ELEMENT ONLY IS RECOMMANDED
 "languages" : ["Python", "R", "Julia"], #you can take a sublist of this one, ONE ELEMENT ONLY IS RECOMMANDED
 "repetition" : 1 #or any integer
}


If you lack inspiration, you can try "file_to_upload.json" or the example file.

- Then click on the "Upload file" button and wait until "Success" is displayed.

- Finally, click on "Open result" to print the result.

- Click on the cross to close the window and delete the uploaded JSON.
